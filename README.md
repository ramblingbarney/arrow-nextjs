This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Why

<Company Name> - Mini-project Assessment
For this position we are asking all promising applicants to complete a short mini-project using React before we
move on to interviews.
For this please could you complete the following instructions:

1. Use Vite to set up a fresh React project and remove all of the code except the react icon. Add it as the
   initial commit to a git repository.
2. Change the code so that the react icon rotates and the direction reverses each time the user clicks it.
3. Change the code to adjust the size of the react icon depending on the position of the cursor on the
   page.
4. Change the code so that the text under the icon displays the amount of time the mouse has been
   WITHIN the visible page, but NOT moving.
5. Add a sidebar that can be shown/hidden where any of the previous changes can be switched on or off.
   I have deliberately left the instructions a bit vague so use your judgement where the details are lacking.....

## Why NextJs

Jest setup documentation for NextJs exists, after spending hours dealing with cryptic error messages because I don't use Vite for my projects I went with a proven framework. I could now transfer my setup learned knowledge to Vite for the future.

## If this was a basis for an ongoing project

- Effort would be put into making it look pretty

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
